## Abstract. 

Currently, in Mexico, urban areas still lack the infrastructure to communicate with the population through telecommunication technologies, this is one of the main problems faced by emergency services by the authorities. The proposed system has been designed to achieve the greatest coverage in highway sections and thus be able to satisfy the emergency demands of citizens to achieve an efficient response without losing the security of messages of this nature under conditions of low signal intensity. and to be able to avoid potential attacks from the message itself. The present research work develops a comparison between different encryption algorithms obtained through hardware implementation, through the MQTT protocol under a C-V2X system, said comparison is oriented in experimental scenarios of low signal intensity.
